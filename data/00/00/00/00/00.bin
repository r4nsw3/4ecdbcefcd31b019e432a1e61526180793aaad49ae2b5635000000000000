  |   On the Nintendo Switch, you can now experience the crazy couch        |
  |   co-operative action of Overcooked wherever you choose. Simply         |
  |   remove the Nintendo Switch console from the Nintendo Switch Dock to   |

  |   chefs travelling around the Onion Kingdom!                            |

  |   The Onion Kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save   |
  |   it! In Overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel     |
  |   and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable    |
  |   of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land.          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Overcooked Special Edition features all the exhilarating (and         |
  |   enraging) kitchens from the main game, as well as both expansions,    |
  |   'The Lost Morsel' and 'Festive Seasoning'.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A CULINARY QUEST.                                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Onion Kingdom is a rich world full of cruel and unusual           |
  |   kitchens for you to conquer. Take part in an epic journey and         |
  |   tackle an increasingly challenging and bizarre gauntlet of kitchens   |
  |   which will push your skills of co-operation and co-ordination to      |
  |   the very limits. Each level brings a new challenge for you and your   |
  |   team to overcome, whether it's sliding around on a pirate ship,       |
  |   moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving     |
  |   food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the    |
  |   mettle of even the bravest chefs.                                     |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Overcooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun,     |
  |   but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their          |
  |   actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a well-oiled    |
  |   team of super-chefs will come out on top!                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With Nintendo Switch HD Rumble, become immersed in the crazy          |
  |   culinary antics like never before.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Whether indulging in deep fried local co-op or saut√©ed single         |
  |   player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new    |
  |   chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow     |
  |   teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Just like cooking itself, Overcooked is best enjoyed with friends!    |
  |   Call in backup from a buddy by detaching the Joy-Con controllers      |
  |   and get to work! Add in an extra set of Joy-Con controllers or two    |
  |   Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers and you can play with up to four      |
  |   players for even more frantic fun.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You'll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together     |
  |   in order to become the most effective and ultimate team! However      |
  |   you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get       |
  |   ready to enter the kitchen!                                           |
  |                                                                         |
